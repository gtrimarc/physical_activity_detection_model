# physical_activity_detection_model
IPython notebook to develop a model that detects levels of physical activities using pulse readings 
from smartwatches or other wearable devices. Here, I used the PAMAP2 dataset from the UC Irvine to
train a support vector machine classifier to associate the pulse readings to the level of physical
activity.
