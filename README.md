# Pulse2act : a model that turns pulse readings into intensity of physical activity

IPython notebook to develop a model that detects levels of physical activities using pulse readings 
from smartwatches or other wearable devices. Here, I used the PAMAP2 dataset from the UC Irvine
Machine Learning dataset repository and accessible through this URL

I used the dataset to train a support vector machine classifier to associate the pulse readings to
intensity levels of the physical activity of the subject.
